# Facebook AI Hatefull Memes Detection  

The code in this repository is part of my submission in the Facebook AI competition [link to competition](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/64/hateful-memes/page/205/)  
It is a complex problem that you have text and image and you have to detect if it is a hatefull image or not.  
The dataset is extremely privayte and can't be shared.  
In this python program ResNet152 is used impemented in Pytorch for the image part. The result will be fused with the text classification result.
